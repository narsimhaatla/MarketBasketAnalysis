## Market Basket Analysis Readme
This repository contains scripts and instructions for conducting Market Basket Analysis (MBA) using R. MBA is a data mining technique used to uncover associations between products purchased together by customers. The analysis aims to understand purchasing patterns and improve strategies such as product placement and promotions.

Ensure you have R installed on your system. Additionally, the following R packages are required:

tidyverse
arules
arulesViz
gridExtra
ggthemes
dplyr
readxl
plyr
ggplot2
knitr
lubridate
kableExtra
RColorBrewer
You can install these packages using the install.packages() function in R.

# Instructions
Clone Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install Required Packages: Install the required R packages mentioned above using the provided command.


install.packages(c("tidyverse", "arules", "arulesViz", "gridExtra", "ggthemes", "dplyr", "readxl", "plyr", "ggplot2", "knitr", "lubridate", "kableExtra", "RColorBrewer"))

Load Libraries: Load the installed libraries into your R environment.

Load Data: Load your transaction data into R. You can use the provided script to load the data from an Excel file.

retail <- read_excel('path_to_your_excel_file')
Data Cleaning: Clean the loaded data to prepare it for analysis. This may include converting data types, handling missing values, and restructuring the data if necessary.

Convert to Transaction Data: Convert the cleaned data into a transaction format suitable for market basket analysis.

tr <- read.transactions('path_to_transaction_data_file', format = 'basket', sep=',')
Analyze Data: Perform market basket analysis using association rule mining techniques.

Visualize Results: Visualize the discovered association rules and other insights obtained from the analysis.
